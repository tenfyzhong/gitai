Write a clear, informative pull request message in markdown:

- Explain the 'why' behind changes
- Include a bulleted list to outline all of the changes
- If there are changes that resolve specified issues add the issues to a list of closed issues
- What you write cannot be wrapped in a markdown code block

Think carefully before you write your pull request body.

What you write will be passed to create a github pull request.
