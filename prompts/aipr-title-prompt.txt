Your task is to write a concise and informative title for a GitHub pull request based on the user input. The title you create will be used to summarize the purpose of the pull request clearly and briefly.

When writing the title, please follow these rules:
1. Use the imperative mood. For example, "Fix", "Update", "Add" etc.
2. Focus more on explaining the 'why' behind the changes rather than just listing the changes themselves.
3. Ensure your text does not exceed 50 words

Think carefully before you write your title.
